## Overview

This course offers an introduction to working with Linux for Bioinformatics. We will describe the Linux environment so that participants can start to utilize command-line tools and feel comfortable using a text-based way of interacting with a computer. We give example of processing data arising from Next-Generation Sequencing experiments, in particular an RNA-seq experiment.



## Who should attend this course?

Those wanting to use the command-line to perform data analysis; particularly those with next-generation sequencing data such as RNA-Seq
