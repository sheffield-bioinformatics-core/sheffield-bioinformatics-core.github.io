Emily left the Bioinformatics Core in December 2024 to pursue a Data Technical Lead role in IT-Services as part of the [Data Connect](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/data-connect) project.

## Experience

* 2024 - Present: Data Technical Lead - IT Services, University of Sheffield
* 2017 - 2024: Bioinformatician - Bioinformatics Core Facility, University of Sheffield
* 2013 - 2016: Postdoctoral Research Fellow - The [Roslin Institute](https://www.ed.ac.uk/roslin), University of Edinburgh

## About Emily
Emily obtained her PhD in the computational biology group of Prof. Colin Semple at the MRC Human Genetics Unit at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). Her PhD thesis studied [evolutionary divergence of mammalian chromatin structure.](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003017). The main focus of her PhD involved combining multiple differing measurements of chromatin structure from publicly available datasets. This created an orthologous mammalian chromatin dataset to examine for conserved and divergent elements of chromatin domains. She has also worked as a bioinformatics research fellow at The [Roslin Institute](https://www.ed.ac.uk/roslin) (2014-2017).

## Interests
