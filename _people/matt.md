Matt joined University of Sheffield Bioinformatics Core in May 2018 to provide support for the Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) 
and other university projects in addition to strengthening the clinical bioinformatics services. He was instrumental in delivering 
\>10,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes as part of COG-UK. I bring my experience in the delivery of genomics at scale to the Sheffield
Bioinformatics Core. With a H-index of 28 and > 11,000 citations he has made a measureable impact on the field of genomics.
