# New Bioinformatics Course: Analysis of Biological Networks using Cytoscape

The Sheffield Bioinformatics Core is pleased to announce a new one-day course on using the Cytoscape software for the interpretation and visualisation of gene networks.

This highly-regarded and free software, that does not require any prior Bioinformatics experience, will allow you to extract biological meaning from your existing RNA-seq results (or other omics data) and produce publication-ready network diagrams and figures.

The course will take place on **Wednesday June 12th** from 9:30 to 16:30 with **in-person and online** options available. Please use this link to secure a place. Or if you prefer to pay using a grant code or cost centre you can email the Bioinformatics Core directly and we can arrange this.
