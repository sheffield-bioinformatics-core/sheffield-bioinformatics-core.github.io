The Sheffield Bioinformatics Core (SBC) team at the University of Sheffield strives to:

- Enhance the Universityâ€™s capacity for producing high quality, Bioinformatics analysis and thus increasing research impact and decreasing time to publication.
- Provide a range of Bioinformatics skills (see our [expertise](/collaboration/expertise) via a pool of staff to support
research grants, thereby increasing the capability of research units and helping to meet the
requirements and expectations of funders.

- Act as the hub of a university community that supports good practice in research software.

The SBC team can collaborate with you to help improve your biological / health research.
We have a pool of [expert staff](/contact/team) to ensure that you can deliver best-practice Bioinformatics analysis on your research projects (see [testimonials](/collaboration/testimonials/)).
Supporting the entire University, we have collaborators in every faculty and have supported researchers in a range of subject areas including Biosciences, Chemical and Biological Engineering, Clinical Medicine and Neuroscience.
Please contact us (<bioinformatics-core@sheffield.ac.uk>) to arrange a [scoping meeting](/collaboration/provision).

### Why work with the SBC Team

The SBC Team allows you to get dedicated Bioinformatics support.
Recruitment of such skills is very difficult on research projects,
especially when you only require short term expertise.
UKRI (and most other UK and EU funding agencies) understand what an import part Core Facilities have on research and
would like to see that they are being offered sustainable careers with academia.
