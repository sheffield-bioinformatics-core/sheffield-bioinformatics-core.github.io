Once you've seen [What we do](/collaboration/expertise/), you might wonder how well we do it. Here is a selection of testimonials from academics we have collaborated with

Training
-------------

> way back in 2020 you ran a free intro to R course, which I attended.. and you created a bit of a monster! Since then I have done loads of online training on R and associated stats, a bit of Linux and a tonne of web development stuff (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Prior to your course I honestly thought computing was not for me and I'd hate it, but dipping my toe in made it a whole lot less intimidating and I now code for fun 😱😁. I've even contributed some R analysis to a paper .

Code Clinics
--------------------------

> Mark and Emily were very patient, they've not only helped with my issues on a number of occasions but have also ensured that I've understood how to fix the problem. I cant describe how helpful the clinic has been to my research!!! 5*

> Invaluable service. I worked 2 days on correcting error codes for an rRNA filtering package to no avail. 30 minutes into a drop-in-clinic with Emily, we had solved the error together and I had learnt numerous essential bioinformatic tools along the way.

>The issue I needed addressing was resolved. Nobody in my group had the expertise to do this. The clinic allowed me to be able to continue analysing my data.

> Emily was incredibly patient and worked at an appropriate pace so that I was able to ask questions and develop some skills myself, very much appreciated.
