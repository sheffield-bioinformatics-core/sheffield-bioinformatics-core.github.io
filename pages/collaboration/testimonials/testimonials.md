Once you've seen [What we do](/collaboration/expertise/), you might wonder how well we do it. Here is a selection of testimonials from academics we have collaborated with

Training
-------------
> As a clinical PGR with no prior experience of R, I attended the Bioinformatic intro to R course, the RSE Github course and have had a series of appointments at the RSE Code Clinic. The courses were pitched at the perfect level for absolute beginners like me and Code Clinic allowed me to refine my code, improving my understanding of the language and also benefitting from the experience of the RSE team. This service has been the most valuable service I have utilised during my PHD study and I would recommend it to everyone, especially those looking to learn new skills.

> way back in 2020 you ran a free intro to R course, which I attended.. and you created a bit of a monster! Since then I have done loads of online training on R and associated stats, a bit of Linux and a tonne of web development stuff (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Prior to your course I honestly thought computing was not for me and I'd hate it, but dipping my toe in made it a whole lot less intimidating and I now code for fun üò±üòÅ. I've even contributed some R analysis to a paper .

Bioinformatics Support
-----------------------------

> We have worked with Mark and Bioinformatics Core team for several years and continue to collaborate with them on several projects which involve the experimental design, implementation and data analysis of WES and bulk/scRNAseq data. Mark has also helped train several of our PhD students and PDRAs and has co-supervised some of our MSc and PhD students. Additionally, we have been developing novel protocols around single cell and single nuclei RNAseq applications from fresh tumour tissue, and Mark has helped analyse pilot data and liaise with the kit manufacturers and NGS service providers to help drive forward these projects.

Code Clinics
--------------------------

> Mark and Emily were very patient, they've not only helped with my issues on a number of occasions but have also ensured that I've understood how to fix the problem. I cant describe how helpful the clinic has been to my research!!! 5*

> Invaluable service. I worked 2 days on correcting error codes for an rRNA filtering package to no avail. 30 minutes into a drop-in-clinic with Emily, we had solved the error together and I had learnt numerous essential bioinformatic tools along the way.

>The issue I needed addressing was resolved. Nobody in my group had the expertise to do this. The clinic allowed me to be able to continue analysing my data.

> Emily was incredibly patient and worked at an appropriate pace so that I was able to ask questions and develop some skills myself, very much appreciated.
