The Sheffield Bioinformatics Core supports researchers seeking to analyse a wide variety of high-throughput biology and 'omics data
across the university through our community activities.
The best way to keep updated on these is to 
join [**Sheffield Bioinformatics Core's News Google Group**](https://groups.google.com/a/sheffield.ac.uk/g/bioinformatics-core-news):

The mailing list is for moderated announcements only (not discussion).
