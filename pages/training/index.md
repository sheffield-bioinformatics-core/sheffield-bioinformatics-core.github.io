People conducting Bioinformatics analysis for research whether they are performing an RNA-seq analysis or creating a bespoke analysis pipeline need skills that academic training might not provide. 

The SBCâ€™s aspiration is that all researchers who need these skills should be given the opportunity to learn them, either from the SBC Team, our University of Sheffield colleagues or other sources.

If you take one of our courses, you will have an experience and qualified trainer leading the teaching. We take our commitment to training seriously and ensuring that it meets best-practice guidelines. SBC members Mark, Emily and Lewis have all been attended and passed the "train the trainer" instructor training offered by [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/index.html) and have FHEA status through [AdvanceHE](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/).

We appreciate the support of PhD student demonstrators during our workshops. If you have experience of a relevant computational / Bioinformatics technique and would like to get involved please [get in touch](/contact). Your time can be compensated and it will count towards your personal development.

At the moment our workshops have online and in-person attendance options available. If you chose to attend online you will have access to main instructor's screen online. There will be demonstrators online to assist if you have any issues.

Our current teaching format is to run shorter sessions split over multiple days. This is to allow participants time to review the materials in-between sessions.

### IT Services Training

Our colleagues in [IT Services](https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research) offer a range of [free training courses](https://sites.google.com/sheffield.ac.uk/research-training/). This is a good place to look if you want to learn how to generic computational skills such as command-line or High-Performance Computing code, but there are a wide range of other courses there as well.

### Statement on charging for courses

Our courses currently have a registration fee in-line with other providers of Bioinformatics training. We try and keep these fees as low as possible to make them affordable.

Researchers at TuOS can pay via a grant code or cost centre where possible.
