## Biography

After obtaining my first degree in Chemistry, I pursued a PhD in systems biology and computational Biochemistry with [Dr James Smith](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/food-nutrition/staff/7163/dr-james-smith) at the [University of Leeds](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/) (2016-2021). My PhD looked to identify novel drug targets for Basal-like breast cancer. In Sheffield, I work with the Sheffield COVID-19 Genomics Group to support the delivery of a large-scale and rapid whole-genome virus sequencing project, as a part of the [COG-UK](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/medicine/research/research-themes/infection/covid-19).
