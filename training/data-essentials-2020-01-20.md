## Overview

In many domains of research the rapid generation of large amounts of data is fundamentally changing how research is done. The deluge of data presents great opportunities, but also many challenges in managing, analysing and sharing data. 

This workshop is designed to teach basic concepts, skills and tools for working more effectively with data, using a combination of tools with a main focus in R. The workshop is aimed at researchers in the life sciences at all career stages and is designed for learners with little to no prior knowledge of programming, shell scripting, or command line tools


**Please note that this course is funded by the ThinkAhead scheme and only available to staff / students at The University of Sheffield**

## Objectives:- After this course you should be able to:

 
- "Clean" a spreadsheet so that it is ready for analysis in R
- Create a *reproducible* piece of R code to import and visualise data
- Know how to develop your data analysis skills after the course

## Aims:- During this course you will learn about:

- How to avoid common formatting mistakes
- How to use spreadsheet programs (such as Excel) more effectively, and the limitations of such programs
- Writing and executing basic data analysis workflows in R

## Prerequisites

- No prior programming experience is required


## Software installation

You will need to bring an internet-enabled laptop to the course and install the latest versions of R, RStudio and OpenRefind before coming to the course

- [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
- [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/download.html)


### Windows

Install R by downloading and running [this .exe file](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm) from CRAN. Also, please install the [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop). Note that if you have separate user and admin accounts, you should run the installers as administrator (right-click on .exe file and select "Run as administrator" instead of double-clicking). Otherwise problems may occur later, for example when installing R packages.

The latest version of OpenRefine can be downloaded from here:-
https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/releases/download/3.2/openrefine-win-3.2.zip


### Mac

Install R by downloading and running [this .pkg file](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-latest.pkg) from CRAN. Also, please install the free [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) 

The latest version of OpenRefine can be downloaded from here:-

https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/releases/download/3.2/openrefine-mac-3.2.dmg

### Linux

You can download the binary files for your distribution from CRAN. Or you can use your package manager (e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu run `sudo apt-get install r-base` and for Fedora run `sudo yum install R`). Also, please install free [the RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).
