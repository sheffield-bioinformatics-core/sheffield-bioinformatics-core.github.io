## Registration

Registration is now closed. Please [check back](http://sbc.shef.ac.uk//training/) for future dates

## Overview

It has been said that 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning and preparing the data. In this course we introduce some relatively-new additions to the R programming language; dplyr and ggplot2. In combination these provide a powerful toolkit to make the process of manipulating and visualising data easy and intuitive. 

## Who should attend this course?

Researchers in life sciences who want to get started using R for their data analysis

## Aims:- After this course you should be able to:

- Import tidy datasets into R and perform some basic data cleaning
- Use dplyr to explore a dataset interactively
- Produce simple analysis workflows in R
- Make publication-ready graphics using ggplot2

## Objectives:- During this course you will learn about:

- What constitues a tidy dataset
- Subseting and filtering datasets using dplyr
- *Piping* commands together to form a workflow
- Producing summary statistics from a dataset
- Joining datasets using dplyr
- The grammar of graphics approach to plotting used in ggplot2
- Producing publication-ready graphics using ggplot2


## Prerequisites

We will assume that you have basic familarity with R and are familiar with vectors, data frames, variables and using functions.

## Software installation

You will need to bring an internet-enabled laptop to the course and install the latest versions of *both* R ***and*** RStudio before coming to the course

- [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

### Windows

Install R by downloading and running [this .exe file](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm) from CRAN. Also, please install the [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop). Note that if you have separate user and admin accounts, you should run the installers as administrator (right-click on .exe file and select "Run as administrator" instead of double-clicking). Otherwise problems may occur later, for example when installing R packages.

Please copy and paste the following line of text into an R console to install the R packages required for the course
```
install.packages(c("tidyverse","rmarkdown"))
```


### Mac

Install R by downloading and running [this .pkg file](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-latest.pkg) from CRAN. Also, please install the [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop). 

Please copy and paste the following line of text into an R console to install the R packages required for the course
```
install.packages(c("tidyverse","rmarkdown"))
```

### Linux

You can download the binary files for your distribution from CRAN. Or you can use your package manager (e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu run `sudo apt-get install r-base` and for Fedora run `sudo yum install R`). Also, please install [the RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop). 

Please copy and paste the following line of text into an R console to install the R packages required for the course
```
install.packages(c("tidyverse","rmarkdown"))
```
