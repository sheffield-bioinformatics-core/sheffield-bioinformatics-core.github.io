## Overview

We use a Public Health dataset and examples (NHANES from the US National Center for Health Statistics) but the materials are relevant to researchers more generally in the life, health and social sciences.

The workshop assumes no prior experience of statistical analysis in R. However, learners are expected to have some familiarity with R such as having done an introductory course. 

We have a course scheduled for the January 2022 that will cover sufficient background:-

**At the moment, we are planning to run the course in-person. However, if COVID restrictions prevent us from doing this the course will be run online**

The course will be as follows:

## Day one (a.m.)

*Statistical thinking for public health*
We provide an introduction to statistical concepts commonly used for linear modelling. Mean estimation, linear association and mean prediction are covered.

## Day one (p.m) 

*Simple linear regression for public health*
We cover the concept of simple linear regression and its use with different predictor variables: single continuous variable, single
two-group factor variable and single factor variable with more than two groups.


## Day two (a.m)

*Simple linear regression for public health - fit and assumptions*
In this workshop we go through the assumptions of simple linear regression and ways we can evaluate the fit of our models.

## Day two (p.m)

*Multiple linear regression for public health*
In the final workshop we introduce linear regression with more than one explanatory variable which is known
as multiple linear regression variables. 


## Software installation

You will need to bring an internet-enabled laptop to the course and install the latest versions of *both* R ***and*** RStudio before coming to the course

- [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

### Windows

Install R by downloading and running [this .exe file](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm) from CRAN. Also, please install the [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop). Note that if you have separate user and admin accounts, you should run the installers as administrator (right-click on .exe file and select "Run as administrator" instead of double-clicking). Otherwise problems may occur later, for example when installing R packages.

### Mac

Install R by downloading and running [this .pkg file](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-latest.pkg) from CRAN. Also, please install the free [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) 

### Linux

You can download the binary files for your distribution from CRAN. Or you can use your package manager (e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu run `sudo apt-get install r-base` and for Fedora run `sudo yum install R`). Also, please install free [the RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).
